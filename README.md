The [Subnomicon](https://subnomicon.subspace.network) is a knowledge base about the Subspace Protocol. Subnomicon provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of protocol, covering the following:

1. [Architecture Overview](/docs/overview) - *The Subspace modular architecture.*
2. [Advancing Blockchain](/docs/advancements) - *How Subspace advances the state of blockchain technology.*
3. [Consensus Mechanism](/docs/category/consensus) - *How Subspace achieves consensus through its storage-based design.*
4. [Network Architecture](/docs/category/network-architecture) - *How Subspace is structured as a decentralized network.*
5. [Decoupled Execution](/docs/category/decoupled-execution) - *How Subspace separates consensus and computation.*

The information in the Subnomicon is kept up-to-date with the live state of the Subspace Protocol which may not represent the final desired state. Subnomicon's purpose is to serve as living documentation that grows and evolves with the protocol.
