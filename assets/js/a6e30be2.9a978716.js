These bundles are then submitted to farmers, who treat them as base-layer transactions. Farmers will only verify the proof-of-election and ensure the data is available before batching bundles into blocks in the usual manner. Execution transactions are then ordered deterministically, using a secure cryptographic shuffle based on the unique PoAS produced by the farmer, mitigating the Miner Extractable Value (MEV). Operators then execute the transactions according to this ordering and produce a deterministic state commitment in the form of an execution receipt. These state commitments are then included in the following bundle, forming a deterministic receipt chain tracked by all farmers within the core protocol.
