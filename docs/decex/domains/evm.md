Nova EVM is the foundational domain that supports EVM execution. It allows Ethereum smart contracts to run natively on Autonomys network with higher throughput and lower fees.
The scope of the Nova domain encompasses the ability to deploy, execute, and manage smart contracts and decentralized applications compatible with the Ethereum ecosystem. The domain should enable seamless interaction and interoperability with other domains while maintaining the unique features of an EVM-compatible environment.
